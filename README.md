# BitTorrent Client Design doc
(we can outline our design in this readme as we go or most likely towards the end -- change this as you'd like but keep the logs section :) )


## Logs (may or may not be maintained...)


- 5/03: set up some datastruct fields for torrent parsing; needs testing but seems good as of now; don't know if the current structure is optimal, but i guess its still nice to have something; we can face hell as we go :);
- 5/03: .torrent file parsing; need to determine some data structure or getters;
- 5/02: team meeting; organization; discussion and plan;


## Development Plan?

1) torrent parsing
2) tracker communication (handshake)
3) piece manager
4) advanced extra cred features intertwined?


## Ideas of how to approach testing?

  - Download time
  - Comparison with other clients
  - Logging (wireshark)
